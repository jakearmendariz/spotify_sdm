# Flask Template

A template for flask web applications, I didn't add a license but please use this repo to start a flask app, the initial set up can be tedious. No actual code is used here, just a demonstration of serving static files on a flask server and how to write a small Dockerfile to run it.

To run on docker use:<br>
`docker build -t basic .`<br>
`docker run -p 8080:8080 basic`<br>

Or you could just run `python3 app.py` to run it locally
<br>
Best of luck with your flask application
